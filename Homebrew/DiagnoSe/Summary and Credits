DiangnoSe is a Homebrew app designed to check if every part of the DS is functional, it was created by spinal.
*WARNING This was designed for the DS and DS Lite so not every part will work on a DSi.
*WARNING This app has a NAND tester and I did not test it and personally don't want to as I don't want to risk damaging my DSi, so you have been warned.
