# DS-Homebrew

This is where I will be storing different Homebrews for the DS and DSI.

I will add a qr code for dsidl for every homebrew I add.

Every QR Code is tested to work on one or more official Nintendo DSI's running Twilight Menu ++.

I have not tested these for r4 cards.

If you want a Homebrew that is not here, make a new issue with the "New Homebrew" tag.

Universal team made dsidl and added qr codes on some homebrew but not many so I guess was also made to have more qr codes.

If you want me remove homebrew that you made, please make an issue with the "Remove Homebrew" and I will do it as fast as I can.

This is purely to learn about ds homebrewing

I also will add themes for Twilight Menu ++ with a QR Code to download them.
