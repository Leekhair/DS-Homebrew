# DS-Homebrew

I'm creating a resource to store DS and DSi homebrew with QR codes for easy access, specifically tested on official DSi consoles running Twilight Menu++. My goal is to make it simpler for users to install homebrew and themes
directly onto their devices. Since the Universal team has contributed some QR codes but not many, I’m expanding this collection to include more homebrew options. If there's a homebrew you want that isn't listed, I encourage
users to open an issue with the "New Homebrew" tag. Likewise, if someone wants me to remove a homebrew, they can create an issue with the "Remove Homebrew" tag, and I'll take care of it as quickly as possible.

This project is a way for me to learn more about DS homebrewing, and I’m hoping it helps others in the community as well. I’ll also be adding themes for Twilight Menu++ with QR codes for easy download. My goal is to keep everything secure, up-to-date, and organized, while also encouraging feedback from the community to ensure the resource stays useful and accurate. By sharing and expanding this collection, I’m hoping to contribute to the homebrew community and make it easier for others to enjoy homebrew on their DSi systems.

If you're looking to mod your DSi, I recommend checking out dsi.cfw.guide. And just to clarify, I'm not affiliated with the site in any way.
