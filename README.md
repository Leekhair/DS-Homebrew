# DS-Homebrew

This is where I will be storing different Homebrews for the DS and DSI.

I will add a qr code for dsidl for every homebrew I add.

If you want a Homebrew that is not here, make a new issue with the "New Homebrew" tag.

If you want me remove homebrew that you made, please make an issue with the "Remove Homebrew" and I will do it as fast as I can.

This is purely to learn about ds homebrewing
